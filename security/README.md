```

## Configuration

### Snyk Authentication
To avoid login prompts and enable full scanning features, set your Snyk auth token:

1. Get your token from: https://app.snyk.io/account
2. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   SNYK_TOKEN=your-snyk-auth-token
   ```
3. Or export as environment variable:
   ```bash
   export SNYK_TOKEN=your-snyk-auth-token
   ```

The scanning script will automatically detect and use the token from either source.

## Usage

### Run Complete Security Scan
```bash
make security-scan
```

This will:
1. Scan Python dependencies (main project)
2. Scan Docker container
3. Scan Python SDK
4. Scan JavaScript SDK
5. Scan Go SDK (if Go is installed)
6. Generate consolidated report

### Other Commands
```bash
make security-report  # Regenerate report from existing artifacts
make security-quick   # Quick Python-only scan
make security-clean   # Clean artifacts (not recommended)
```

## Artifacts

The `artifacts/` directory contains JSON output from security scanning tools. These files are **intentionally committed to Git** as:

1. **Proof of security scanning** - Demonstrates due diligence
2. **Audit trail** - Historical record of security posture
3. **No sensitive data** - Contains only:
   - Vulnerability information
   - Package names and versions
   - Public organization name (already in GitHub URL)
   - Local development paths (not production)

## Report

The main report (`SECURITY_SCAN_REPORT.md`) provides:
- Executive summary
- Vulnerability counts by component
- Compliance status
- Recommendations
- Scan commands for reproduction

## Security Status

As of the last scan:
- **0 vulnerabilities** across all components
- **All SDKs scanned** and secure
- **Docker container** using Alpine Linux (zero vulnerabilities)
- **Dependencies** all up-to-date

## Continuous Security

### Before Each Release
1. Run `make security-scan`
2. Review the report
3. Address any vulnerabilities found
4. Commit updated artifacts and report

### Regular Maintenance
- Weekly: Check for new CVEs
- Monthly: Update base Docker image
- Quarterly: Full security audit

## Integration with CI/CD

Add to your CI pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Security Scan
  run: make security-scan
  
- name: Check for Vulnerabilities
  run: |
    VULNS=$(jq '.vulnerabilities | length' security/artifacts/snyk/python-report.json)
    if [ "$VULNS" -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "Found $VULNS vulnerabilities!"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Tools Used

- **Snyk CLI** - Primary vulnerability scanner
- **npm audit** - JavaScript dependency scanner
- **govulncheck** - Go vulnerability checker (when available)

## Notes

- Artifacts are kept as proof of scanning
- No sensitive information is stored in artifacts
- Reports use current date, not versioned
- Single source of truth: `SECURITY_SCAN_REPORT.md`
